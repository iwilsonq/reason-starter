# Reason Starter

This project is very similar to a project created by running `bsb -init reason-starter`, with the exception that I've slightly modified the bsconfig.json and package.json files to my liking.

# Build & Watch

These scripts compile ReasonML code to JavaScript.

```
npm run build
```

```
npm run watch
```

# Execute

This executes the compiled JavaScript. That is, it runs `node lib/js/src/index.js`

```
npm start
```
